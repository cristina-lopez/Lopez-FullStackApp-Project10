# Lopez-FullStackApp-Project10
Project 10 for FSJS Techdegree

In this project, I create the client side of project 9. 

In this full stack app, users are asked to sign in or sign up in order to modify the database of courses.

Once signed in, users can view and create courses, and edit and delete courses they've created.
